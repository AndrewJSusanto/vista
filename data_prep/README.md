# Data Preparation For VISTA

## Optical Flow
We built our code on top of an [addon](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/Super-SloMo) of [Super-SloMo](https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/Super-SloMo) from [Prophsee AI](https://www.prophesee.ai/) to extract optical flow, which is then used to construct continuous-time representation of RGB video stream and event-based camera simulation. For more details, check [here](./Super-SloMo/README.md).

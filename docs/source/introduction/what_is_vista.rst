Goals of VISTA
**************

* Flexible and photorealistic data-driven simulation:
* Research friendly API: modular, customizable, and extensible.
* Sim-to-real and Real-to-sim: Ability to transfer to and from reality and the corresponding digital twins built in VISTA.
* New applications: policy learning, testing and verification, augmented reality,


The Simulator
*************

illustration of the components. description of each component (world, trace, agent, sensor, entities)


Sensor Simulation
*****************
discuss each sensor? for more details on how to spawn each refer
